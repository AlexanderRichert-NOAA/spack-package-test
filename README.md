# GitHub CI Action: test-spack-package

This repository provides a GitHub Action for building and testing packages
through the [Spack package manager](https://spack.io). It achieves this by
[setting up Spack](https://github.com/spack/setup-spack) and setting up the
modified code to be tested using the `spack develop` command. The code is
installed and tested through the `spack install --test` command, which will
therefore work with any build system providing a `make test` or `make check`
target (see [Spack
documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html)). It
is recommended to include a custom `check()` function in the recipe to ensure
that the appropriate target is run, as the generic test functionality in Spack
does not fail when the `test` and `check` targets do not exist.

This repository supports [NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS) CI
workflows.

Features:
- Build caching of dependencies through GitHub Packages (enabled by default)
- Supports compiling and unit testing downstream dependents through Spack to
  enhance code testing
- Supports custom Spack recipes (must be contained within the same repository),
  which allows for packages to be tested that do not exist in the Spack
  repository

To submit bug reports, feature requests, or other code-related issues including
usage questions, please create a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/ci-test-spack-package/issues). For general
NCEPLIBS inquiries, contact [Ed Hartnett](mailto:edward.hartnett@noaa.gov)
(secondary point of contact [Alex Richert](mailto:alexander.richert@noaa.gov)).

### Usage

To use this Action, include the following step in your GitHub Actions workflow
for a code to be built and tested as a Spack package:
```
    - name: "Test with Spack"
      uses: NOAA-EMC/ci-test-spack-package@v2.0
      with:
        package-name: foo
        package-variants: ${{ matrix.variants-to-test }}
        spack-compiler: gcc@11
        cache-secret: ${{ secrets.my-build-cache-secret }}
        custom-recipe: spack/package.py
        spack-ref: v0.21.2
```

See `actions.yml` for the full list of available options and their defaults.
